# Web-Application-for-UTA-Research-

Topic

The purpose of this project is to design a website for the research projects that are carried out at University of Texas at Arlington, specific to department (Computer Science and Engineering). This is implemented using HTML5, CSS3 for the front-end part of the application and PHP for the backend part of the application.  

Motive

Being the model 21st century urban research university, there is an urgent need to come up with an application that will relay the information regarding the research activities carried out at the University of Texas at Arlington. 
Also, the web application mainly aims at helping the budding research enthusiasts and ambitious students who are seeking for opportunities in the field of Computer Science research which are currently offered at the University. 

Accomplishments

Based on the above need, we plan to build a web application which provides the relevant information regarding Researches, Faculty details, Area of Specialization, Grants, Honors and Publications. This interactive web application is a one-stop solution to all the research related queries. 

Deliverables of the project

Our plan is that by the end of the semester we will deliver as follows:
•	We plan to include an attractive and user-friendly UI, which includes various segments with respect to the research being conducted at UTA. 
•	What technology the research is pioneering in, the various Doctoral and Post-Doctoral students working on research.
•	Various honors, grants and achievements bestowed to that field of research.
•	Show a list of the published research papers in renowned publications.
•	Providing the users with a chance to communicate with the faculty that aligns with their interests and make new connections.
•	Ability to provide a feedback about the research and the website.
•	Provide sneak-peek into the news and events related to the research happening on-campus.

Users 

Primary users of our system are college students, faculty involved in the research and potential students who will be taking up the research. Also, we can grant access to business sectors such as R&D departments, IT companies(startups) who will be funding the research and various sponsors’.  

Content 

The main content of our database will have registered user’s info, Faculty info, research details related to the publications, area of research, grants etc., where the data is obtained from the UTA Research website.
